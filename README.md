R.I.P Flashcord died 8 july


# Flashcord developement has ceased indefinitely
This project is now maintained by the community and newer versions are now based off the last "Ceres" version.

##### [The source for the default background for the "CBM" mode in Ceres is available here.](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/115204201)

‚ö†Ô∏è The following images of Flashcord are outdated (as they are from Flashcord Beta), new images of Flashcord Ceres will be displayed soon.

# üì∏ This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.
## It's all about the chat space.

## But also for the eye candy.

## The ridiculously insane [customization](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Variables#%EF%B8%8F-custom-background-mode) and [integration](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-Modules).

## And the whole [new layer of expression](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Chat-Effects) for messages.

# üìë Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**

Flashcord is currently in Beta, expect lots of things to change and quickly! Next major version will be Flashcord Gamma, set to release in 2024 if everything goes according to plan. By 2025, Flashcord should hopefully be done.
